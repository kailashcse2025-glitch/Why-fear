Main Workflow
Add Night Memory: Navigate to the "Add Memory/Schedule" screen and select "Night Memory." Enter any thoughts, worries, or items you quickly remembered before sleeping (e.g., "Must carry the new keys," "Need to check the oven," etc.).

Add Tomorrow Task: On the same screen, select "Tomorrow's Schedule" and input your itinerary (e.g., "9 AM Meeting with Sarah," "Buy milk after work," "Gym at 6 PM").

Ask AI Analysis : Click the "AI Analysis" button. The application sends the combined memory and schedule data to the Gemini model.

Review Prediction: The AI provides a structured, five-point summary of what you are most likely to overlook, along with safety and preparation reminders.

Log Forgotten Incidents (Optional): Use the "Log Forgotten Incident" screen to record items you actually forgot today. This builds a personal history for review.
